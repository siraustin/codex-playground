This repository contains directories for every letter of the alphabet (A-Z).
Each lettered folder includes two files:

- `food.txt` with a haiku about a food that begins with the folder's letter.
- `vibe.txt` with a haiku describing a vibe or feeling starting with that letter.

All haikus follow the traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure.
