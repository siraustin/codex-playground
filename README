This repository contains directories for each letter from A to Z.
Inside every directory are two files:
  - food.txt: a haiku referencing a food that begins with the directory letter.
  - vibe.txt: a haiku describing a vibe that begins with the same letter.
All haikus follow the traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure.
